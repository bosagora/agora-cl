## Terms of Use

Effective as of Oct 25, 2022

By downloading, accessing or using the Agora-cl implementation (“Agora-cl”), you (referenced herein as “you” or the “user”) certify that you have read and agreed to the terms and conditions below (the “Terms”) which form a binding contract between you and BOSAGORA (referenced herein as “we” or “us”). If you do not agree to the Terms, do not download or use Agora-cl.

### About Agora-cl
Agora-cl is a client implementation for BOSAGORA consensus protocol for a proof-of-stake blockchain. To participate in the network, a user must send BOA from the execution chain into a validator deposit contract, which will queue in the user as a validator in the system. Validators participate in proposing and voting on blocks in the protocol, and the network applies rewards/penalties based on their behavior. A detailed set of installation and usage instructions as well as breakdowns of each individual component are available in the official documentation portal, however, we do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of this documentation. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk.

### Licensing Terms
Agora-cl is a fully open-source software program licensed pursuant to the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The BOSAGORA name, the term “Agora-cl” and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs and slogans are trademarks of BOSAGORA or its affiliates and/or licensors. You must not use such marks without our prior written permission.

### Risks of Operating Agora-cl
The use of Agora-cl and acting as a validator on the BOSAGORA network can lead to loss of money. BOSAGORA is still an experimental system and BOA remains a risky investment. You alone are responsible for your actions on Agora-cl including the security of your BOA and meeting any applicable minimum system requirements.

Use of Agora-cl and the ability to receive rewards or penalties may be affected at any time by mistakes made by the user or other users, software problems such as bugs, errors, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries or malware affecting the network, technical failures in the hardware of a user, security problems experienced by a user and/or actions or inactions of third parties and/or events experienced by third parties, among other risks. We cannot and do not guarantee that any user of Agora-cl will make money, that the Agora-cl network will operate in accordance with the documentation or that transactions will be effective or secure.

We make no claims that Agora-cl is appropriate or permitted for use in any specific jurisdiction. Access to Agora-cl may not be legal by certain persons or in certain jurisdictions or countries. If you access Agora-cl, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

Some Internet plans will charge an additional amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn’t included in the plan and may terminate your connection without warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your bandwidth use so that you can stop Agora-cl before you reach your upload limit.

BOSAGORA AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT AGORA-CL FOR ANY PURPOSE, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTY UNDER THE UNIFORM COMPUTER INFORMATION TRANSACTIONS ACT AS ENACTED BY ANY STATE. WE ALSO MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT AGORA-CL WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR IN A MANNER THAT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND/OR NEEDS.

The foregoing limitations and disclaimers shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. You acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability afforded us hereunder constitute a material and actual inducement and condition to entering into these Terms, and are reasonable, fair and equitable in scope to protect our legitimate interests in light of the fact that we are not receiving consideration from you for providing Agora-cl.

### Indemnification
