# Agora-cl: A forked version of the Ethereum Consensus Implementation Written in Go

### Getting Started

A detailed set of installation and usage instructions as well as breakdowns of each individual component are available in the [official documentation portal](https://agora-cl-docs.bosagora.org). If you still have questions, feel free to stop by our [Telegram](https://t.me/bosagora_eng).

### Staking on Mainnet

To participate in staking, you can use the [official Agora staking site](https://agora-staking.bosagora.org/). This site is the only recommended way to become a validator on mainnet. You can explore validator rewards/penalties via the consensus layer explorer: [agorascan](https://www.agorascan.io/), and follow the latest blocks added to the chain on [boascan](https://www.boascan.io/).
